--------
ABOUT
--------
This is version 2.0.x of the attendance block. It is still IN DEVELOPMENT and should not be considered a stable release unless otherwise noted. It has been tested on Moodle 1.8+, MySQL and PHP 4.4+.

The attendance block was start development by the Human Logic Development Team, Dubai, UAE.
Visit them online at www.human-logic.com

Development of 1.0 branch was continue by Dmitry Pupinin (dlnsk at ngs dot ru). This branch isn't compatibly with version 1.2 from Human Logic!

Change the major number to 2.0 is way to show greater differences of new version from version 1.0.x and 1.2 from Human Logic! In this version main part of code moved to module attforblock! Now block is just additional feature for module.

More information about attforblock module read in corresponding directory.

-----------
PURPOSE
-----------
The attendance module and block are designed to allow instructors of a course keep an attendance log of the students in their courses. The instructor will setup the frequency of his classes (# of days per week & length of course) and the attendance block is ready for use. To take attendance, the instructor clicks on the "Update Attendance" button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course, along with 4 options: Present, Absent, Late & Excused, with a Remarks textbox. Instructors can download the attendance for their course in Excel format or text format.
Only the instructor can update the attendance data. However, a student gets to see his attendance record.

----------------
INSTALLATION
----------------
The attendance follows standard installation procedures. Place the "attendance" directory in your blocks directory, "attforblock" directory in your mod directory. Please delete old language files from your moodledata/lang/en directory if you are upgrading the module. Then visit the Admin page in Moodle to activate it.

--------------
QUESTIONS ?
--------------
If you have questions, concerns or comments about this branch of block, you can post to either the Moodle forums or contact me directly at dlnsk at ngs dot ru

Q: Why attendance percent on pages of block don't equal to percent in Gradebook?
A: Gradebook display how much points student had in this course in comparison with how much he could have. Pages of block display percent of attendance. For example, if student for presence had 3 points and for absence had 1 point then he can't have 0% in Gradebook even though he was absent always, but on block pages in this situation he will have exactly 0%.



Thanks!
